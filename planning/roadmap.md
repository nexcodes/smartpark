## SMART PARKING ALLOCATION & MANAGEMENT ROADMAP

- **Language:** Python
- **UI:** Tkinter

## Phase 1: Requirement Understanding & System Design

### 1.1 Understand the Problem Domain

Break the system into **real-world entities**:

- City → Zones → Parking Areas → Parking Slots
- Vehicles
- Parking Requests
- Allocation + Rollback
- Analytics

### 1.2 Decide Core Data Structures (DSA Focus)

Avoid STL maps/graphs for core logic.

Suggested structures:

- **Arrays / Dynamic Arrays** → Zones, Parking Areas
- **Linked Lists** → Parking requests history
- **Stacks** → Rollback mechanism
- **Queues** → Incoming parking requests
- **Enums + State Machine** → Request lifecycle

### 1.3 Define State Machine

```text
REQUESTED → ALLOCATED → OCCUPIED → RELEASED
REQUESTED → CANCELLED
ALLOCATED → CANCELLED
```

Invalid transitions must be blocked.

---

## Phase 2: Core Logic Implementation (Without UI)

> ⚠️ Important: **Finish all logic in console mode first**
> Tkinter UI should only _call_ these functions.

---

### 2.1 Class-by-Class Implementation

#### ParkingSlot

Responsibilities:

- Slot ID
- Zone ID
- Availability
- Occupied Vehicle ID

Key methods:

- `allocate(vehicleId)`
- `release()`

---

#### ParkingArea

Responsibilities:

- Collection of parking slots
- Find first available slot

DSA:

- Array of `ParkingSlot`

---

#### Zone

Responsibilities:

- Zone ID
- Parking areas
- Logical adjacency (custom structure)

DSA:

- Array of ParkingArea
- Custom adjacency list (array of zone IDs)

---

#### Vehicle

Responsibilities:

- Vehicle ID
- Preferred zone

---

#### ParkingRequest

Responsibilities:

- Vehicle ID
- Requested zone
- Timestamp
- Current state

Includes:

- Enum `RequestState`

---

### 2.2 Allocation Engine

Responsibilities:

- Same-zone allocation first
- Cross-zone allocation with penalty
- Enforce rules

Methods:

- `allocateSlot(ParkingRequest&)`
- `cancelRequest(ParkingRequest&)`

---

### 2.3 Rollback Manager

Core DSA component.

Use:

- **Stack of operations**

Each stack entry stores:

- Slot ID
- Previous availability
- Request previous state

Supports:

- Rollback last **k** operations

---

### 2.4 Parking System (Controller)

Acts as the **brain**:

- Holds all zones
- Manages requests
- Connects allocation + rollback
- Stores history for analytics

---

## Phase 3: Analytics Module

### Metrics to Implement

- Average parking duration
- Zone utilization rate
- Cancelled vs completed requests
- Peak usage zone

DSA Used:

- Traversing linked lists
- Counters & accumulators

⚠️ Must handle **rollback-adjusted data**

---

## Phase 4: Tkinter UI Integration

### 4.1 Tkinter Project Setup

- Tkinter Application (included with Python standard library)
- Virtual environment setup (optional)
- No additional dependencies required

### 4.2 UI Screens

Minimum recommended screens:

1. **Main Dashboard**

   - Total slots
   - Occupied slots
   - Active requests

2. **Parking Request Screen**

   - Vehicle ID input
   - Zone selection
   - Request parking button

3. **Allocation Status Screen**

   - Slot allocated
   - Zone
   - Penalty if cross-zone

4. **Cancellation & Rollback Screen**

   - Cancel request
   - Rollback last k operations

5. **Analytics Screen**

   - Table + labels (Treeview or Text widget)

---

### 4.3 Tkinter → Python Core Communication

Tkinter UI should:

- Call methods from `ParkingSystem`
- Never store logic inside UI classes

Example:

```python
def on_request_parking_clicked(self):
    vehicle_id = self.vehicle_id_entry.get()
    zone_id = self.zone_id_entry.get()
    self.parking_system.create_request(vehicle_id, zone_id)
```

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 6)

### Required Test Cases

At least **10**, including:

- Same-zone allocation
- Cross-zone allocation
- Cancellation before allocation
- Cancellation after allocation
- Rollback correctness
- Invalid state transition rejection
- Analytics after rollback

---
